# bitburner-scripts
just my collection of tools for the hacking game [BitBurner.](https://danielyxie.github.io/bitburner/)

## early game
early game I just use the early-hack-template script from the tutorial, for the most part.

## mid/late game
once a considerable amount of ram is available, daemon.ns can be used.
daemon.ns isn't a distributed tool, you have to have lots of ram on a single machine
(and probably a pretty high hack lvl in the case of higher level servers) in order to
use it effectively.

## bitnode stage
Will upload whatever tools I make for that stage when I get around to it.

## notes
spidercrack.ns is obsolete, use open_sesame.ns
